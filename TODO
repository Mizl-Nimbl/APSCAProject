DONE

    error handling for unexpected inputs  (instead of anything else we should make a chat command that puts you in a while loop while you chat)
    state the purpose in the console
    
    i had my parents test this over the weekend, the only feedback i got was the error handling thing, and that we should have a website
    that people can copy and paste into the console, so that they dont need to get their own. 

NOT DONE

    add getter and setter methods as per the rubric.
