him in, 21
took him, 21
which was, 21
as , 21
that had, 21
the steels, 21
take care, 21
it then, 21
the chemical, 21

went away, 22
give him, 22
we have, 22
as before, 22

me i, 22
carbon tool, 22
which he, 22
the cast, 22
into her, 22
go into, 23
carbon in, 23
do it, 23
at all, 23
when i, 23
it away, 23
she thought, 23
bessemer process, 23
carbon and, 23
come to, 23
fell down, 23
the castings, 23
i should, 23
jane clermont, 23
and now, 23
more or, 23
to run, 23
and so, 23
and on, 23
took it, 23
the youngest, 23
they will, 23
at this, 23
they are, 23
let me, 23
will have, 23
