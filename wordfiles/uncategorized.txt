i
have
recently
had
dreams
of
how
I
will
die.
I
am
in
hell.
in
this
hell,
I
am
being
tortured
and
tortured
badly.
I
am
put
into
a
coffin
for
hours
and
hours.
I
am
brought
out
of
the
coffin,
put
on
a
wooden
plank,
and
put
onto
some
sort
of
platform.
It
does
not
matter
what
I
do.
I
can
not
move.
My
fate
is
set
for
me.
They
will
put
me
in
a
room
with
another
person,
(usually
someone
I
know.
In
one
dream
I
was
in
a
coffin
while
my
two
friends
were
being
tortured.
One
was
a
relative
and
the
other
was
a
friend,
but
neither
knew
the
relative&#39;s
relative.
the
relatives
are
in
fact
demons.
they
are
torturing
me
to
death.
they
are
torturing
my
friend
to
death.
after
some
time
the
chains
are
unhooked
from
the
platform,
I
get
off
the
plank
and
jump
to
the
ground.
then
I
wake
up.

is
the
word
